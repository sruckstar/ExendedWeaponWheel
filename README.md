# ExendedWeaponWheel
You can now eat snacks and put on armor using the Weapon Wheel, just like in GTA Online: The Criminal Enterprises.

Snacks and armor can be found in the houses of the characters (you can see the location in the screenshots). You can only take one body armor and a limited number of snacks with you (snack limits are the same as in GTA Online).

There is support for both the keyboard and controller, but you can not change the purpose of the buttons in the settings yet. This will be resolved in the next version, if the mod will be in demand.
